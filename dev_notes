âœ… How to Think Like a Developer 
ðŸ”¥ Always ask:
1. What kind of request is coming in? (GET? POST?)
2. What data is in the request? (form? JSON?)
3. What should I do with it? (save? fetch? delete?)
4. What response should I return?
If you ask these 4 questions every single time, youâ€™ll become fluent in writing view logic.
